I read an article about Facebook bots manipulating votes and scamming people. So I wondered, what would I find if I made my own Selenium bots. I could friend people automatically, “Like” posts automatically, maybe even make a chat bot that people could respond to or control.</p><style>

I started chatting online when I was about 10 years old. My parents put controls in place, but who knows if they worked. There is danger here, and it’s scary. I assume they were trying to protect me from other people, but now that I’m an adult, I’ve realized it’s other people who need protection from me.</p><style>
#id-Screenshot-20180316-111437-png:before {background-image: url("/Screenshot_20180316-111437-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screenshot-20180316-111437-png"><img src="Screenshot_20180316-111437-final.jpg" alt="friendly stranger"></p><p class="" id="idI-started-friending-random-people-in-my-">I started friending random people in my suggested friends feed on Facebook. I got through about 100 before it started to doubly confirm that I knew people in real life. It even gave me a popup warning “Only friend people who you know from real life.” I thought this was just Facebook being manipulative, like their social graph wouldn’t work properly if I friended strangers. I wasn’t really considering the safety of others.</p><style>

When I friended her automatically, after the first connection, she contacted another friend of mine, also named Brian. He sent me a screenshot of their introduction conversation. He thinks it’s my bot who is making fun of him.</p><style>

That makes me sad. It’s like social networking has replaced the part of our brain that makes real emotional connections with pithy, frivolous, un-valued connections.</p><style>
#id-received-10155531960393865-jpeg:before {background-image: url("/received_10155531960393865-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-received-10155531960393865-jpeg"><img src="received_10155531960393865-final.jpg" alt="makes me sad"></p><p class="" id="idUnfortunately--I-dug-even-deeper--The--t">Unfortunately, I dug even deeper. The “thots” I might have expected. What I didn’t expect was crime on an American company’s network. I didn’t expect fraud, scams, lies, to all be rampant on Facebook. I didn’t expect imposters.</p><style>
#id-Screenshot-20180314-095101-png:before {background-image: url("/Screenshot_20180314-095101-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screenshot-20180314-095101-png"><img src="Screenshot_20180314-095101-final.jpg" alt="marine morales"></p><p class="" id="idThis--I-couldn-t-get-over--It-s-like-sat">This, I couldn’t get over. It’s like satire to me, like there is some joker who figured out my plan to make a Facebook bot, and I got put in a bubble with all the other jokers. To pick this apart a little, this person originally contacted me on Facebook, then found my phone number online and texted me. She is wearing Army camo in both profile pictures. Her name is Marine Morales, aka Army Morals.</p><style>
#id-Screenshot-20180221-182040-png:before {background-image: url("/Screenshot_20180221-182040-final.jpg");}</style><p class="IMG" id="id-Screenshot-20180221-182040-png"><img src="Screenshot_20180221-182040-final.jpg" alt="thots"></p><p class="STRONG" id="idThis-lady-tried-to-point-out-something-u">This lady tried to point out something unusual, at one point she sent me a profile of someone claiming to be a model for her modeling agency. I had an important revelation, what if there was a safe way to teach young women about their sexuality, without it turning in to a slippery slope of human trafficking? For example, what if there was a modeling agency where people <strong>aren’t</strong> grabbed by the pussy?</p><style>

When I was younger we used the International Relay Chat (IRC). My parents used a monitoring system called HackerWhacker. It logged everything I did and said on the computer. I had to use the Windows API to “hack” the program and clear the logs. When that didn’t work, my parents required that I print out a list of my entire friend list and explain to them every person I was talking to and how I knew them. I wasn’t allowed to talk to people I didn’t know personally. I lied.</p><style>

This company is one of the child companies, offering automated social networking bots. They are responsible for some of the misinformation from Russian hacking.</p><style>

I found evidence that Facebook has raffles and prizes, but this is just weird. What do these people have to gain? They didn’t ask for any credit card information, and they weren’t trying to lead me to another website. They simply said show up at Facebook headquarters with these codes. Very strange, and added to my paranoia and distrust.</p><style>

I had to look this up. Apparently, a stripper can legally impersonate an officer, because it isn’t the police costume itself that makes impersonating an officer illegal, it is what you do with it. If a person commits <em>another</em> crime by impersonating an officer, that is what makes it illegal. So, does this mean the Federal Gaming Commission should crack down on people offering fake prizes? Or is this Federal Communication Commission jurisdiction? Either way, scams are a huge problem that neither of those billion dollar expense budgets are willing to solve. Anyone who wants to talk about abolishing big government should consider how much waste there is currently. What is the purpose of the FCC if they can’t stop the dozens of scam calls I get every week?</p><style>

What are they trying to pull? I was ready to go to Facebook Headquarters and threaten them in person to delete my account and data or I’d kill myself in their front office. I could have really used that $700k I was promised for good. It’s like holding a carrot out in front of me. I wonder what they would have said if I actually showed up at their office with some random number they don’t care about. Zuckerberg/Sandberg are amoral cunts.</p><style>

They were even willing to pay me. It’s incredible to me how much money and effort is spent on QuickBooks and how over complicated it looks. Who programs such awful software? Why have they never watched a person use their software and thought to themselves “this looks convoluted and crazy.” Or, “maybe there is a better way to design this?”</p><style>

Travis Hern from Impact Church told an audience of 200 that they aren’t allowed to use the word “Karma” because it doesn’t come from his religion. Here’s a verse for him: <a href="/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203&amp;version=WE">2 Timothy 3 - Pretty much the entire chapter</a> applies to the end of the world. But basically, in the end times, people won’t know right from wrong. If there is anything I can’t stand, it’s when other people tell me how to think and how to speak. I don’t agree with censorship. Words exist for a reason, it doesn’t matter if you agree with the use of a word, the reason for its existence still matters. Like mormons who tell other people not to use “profanities” make me want to enumerate every word they have ever used that doesn’t come from the bible. They are only allowed to use words in the bible apparently. Mormons are the biggest perpetrators of William Shakespear’s “Even the devil can quote scripture for his purpose.” That’s exactly what has happened to Christianity in America. There is no difference between the people who impose religion on their children when they don’t follow the instructions themselves.</p><style>

Hopefully, by now anyone can see there are a lot of dangers that people aren’t protected from. There is a sense of urgency to help people in developing countries. Meanwhile, people in those same developing countries might use American dollars $$$ to buy drugs or weapons. There is no way to trust someone on the internet. There is no way to verify somebody’s identity, yet we spend so much typing typing in pin codes to unlock our phones just for some border patrol to break in to it. Yeah, I’m indignant.</p></div>
